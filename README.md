# strict-machine-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle from the [Strict Machine 0.1](https://github.com/digitalpetri/strict-machine/tree/v0.1) of [Strict Machine](https://github.com/digitalpetri/strict-machine) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I use this with the following bundles.
- [SLF4J 1.7.26](https://www.slf4j.org/)

I would like to thank the authors of this very useful Strict Machine code, and all the contributors.
